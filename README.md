## What is GuiLite?
- GuiLite has 5000 lines of C++ code, providing **UI framework for all platforms** for developers. Just like the pictures above, GuiLite can run on iOS, Android, GNU/Linux, Windows and macOS platforms.
- GuiLite is a embedded UI framework. It can work with Qt/MFC/UWP/XCode, which means you can get not only GuiLite features but also iOS/Android/macOS/Qt/MFC/UWP features.
- GuiLite can work with other languages(e.g. Swift, Java, C#).

## New feature: Animation demo -- HelloAnimation

## Demo
GuiLite just a framework, it could not create UI by itself. In order to show how to build UI App with it, We provide some samples for your reference.
