## What is GuiLite?
- GuiLite, a tiny and light framework, has only 5000 lines of C++ code, supporting **all computing platforms**. It could run on iOS, Android, GNU/Linux, Windows, macOS and **all ARM Linux** IOT platforms.
- GuiLite is without reference to OS, it even could run on any kind of **MCU without OS**.
- GuiLite is a embedded framework. It can work with another UI framework such as Qt/MFC/UWP/XCode, which also means that you can get not only GuiLite features but also iOS/Android/macOS/Qt/MFC/UWP features on your project.
- GuiLite can work with other languages(e.g. Swift, Java, C#).

- ‚ö†Ô∏èWe never encourage people accept GuiLite totally and uncritically, but want people master principles of UI itself.
- ‚öôÔ∏èWe hope GuiLite is small enough to help you understand how UI work, and build unique UI yourself.
- üëëYou should be the master of your UI, not any other UI library.

## New feature: Demo on MCU -- HelloWave + HelloParticle
![HelloWave](doc/HelloWave.gif)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![HelloParticle](doc/HelloParticle.gif)
- MCU Hardware: STM32F103ZET6(512K ROM, 64K RAM) + 240*320 16bits color TFT LCD
- MCU Software: None OS + GuiLite
- **Hello Wave has only 100+ lines code!** [Check the code](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLiteSamples/blob/master/HelloWave/UIcode/UIcode.cpp). Showing you how to use wave widget.
- **Hello Particle has only 100- lines code!** [Check the code](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLiteSamples/blob/master/HelloParticle/UIcode/UIcode.cpp). Showing you how to develop particle system.

## Demo
GuiLite is only a framework, it could not create UI by itself. In order to show how to build UI App with it, We provide some samples for you.
- Click [here](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLiteSamples) to preview its effect.
